Well, I tried to squeeze one last visualization out of Tableau and/or R Studio, and failed miserably. With Tableau, I had four different spreadsheets of the Top 100 words from each of my *Firm Foundation* issues. After much mixing and matching, I couldn't get them to play nicely together. Two of the files kept returning "Null" as a value for a big chunk of the data while also not showing big chunks of the data that were there, which was extremely frustrating. Meanwhile, R Studio just didn't want to work with the data at all (screengrab at right). 

In the process of getting the data ready for (non-)visualization, I did play around with Voyant, which remains my favorite tool from this class. I created word clouds and tables showing the most common words in each of my issues. I then learned how to make a table in Markdown so I could share that directly on the website instead of linking to GitHub. You can see the results of that work on my [*Firm Foundation* project page](https://pa20bm.github.io/HugoSite/projects/firm_foundation/).
