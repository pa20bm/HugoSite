**March 15**: I tooled around with the Wikidata Query Service, looking through Churches of Christ-related search terms, and was surprised to find only three "instances of" a magazine with the "main subject" of Churches of Christ. I then searched for the *Christian Chronicle*, a movement-affiliated newspaper with more of a journalistic (rather than polemic) inclination. Of course, I realized later that since it's a newspaper, and not a magazine, it shouldn't have shown up in the list anyway, but never mind. Although correctly listed in Wikipedia as affiliated with Churches of Christ, the Wikidata did not include its affiliation, so following the lead of the data entries for *Firm Foundation* and the *Gospel Advocate*, I added a "main subject" of Churches of Christ for the *christian Chronicle*.
