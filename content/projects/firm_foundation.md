### Digitizing and Analyzing the Firm Foundation

Founded in 1884 in Austin, Texas, the *Firm Foundation* grew to become one of the most influential publications affiliated with Churches of Christ, the most conservative of the three main branches of the restorationist Stone-Campbell Movement. As an ostensibly nondenominational group, Churches of Christ relied on informal structures of authority, including ministers at large churches, affiliated college administrators and faculty, and journal editors and writers. By the 1960s, the *Firm Foundation* and the Nashville-based *Gospel Advocate* were the organs through which leaders within the White portion of the movememnt adjudicated doctrinal and ecclesial disputes.

As such, with no denominational arvhives available, these weekly journals are invaluable sources for historians seeking to contextualize mainstream views among Churches of Christ – and, more generally, among Southern White Protestants, of which Churches of Christ comprised a significant, if more fundamentalist, portion – during the turbulent years of the middle 20th century. Although these journals have been digitized (available for purchase from [TLC Publishing](https://www.tomchilders.net/Journals_c_17.html)), this project seeks to begin the painstaking process of converting these PDFs into a format better able to accommodate large-scale computational analysis.

Begun to fulfill assignments for a class on computational methods in the humanities, this project has a number of facets that may be of limited relevance or worth outside of simply practicing various methods for classwork; nevertheless, here are links to my work:
