## Welcome to My Site!

I'm a teaching assistant at Florida State University, where I research and write about the intersection between fundamentalist groups and American culture.

How did Churches of Christ respond to the teaching of evolution in public schools? What role did news media play in the Texas raid of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints? How important were Christian artists like Petra to the shaping of material and doctrinal culture in evangelical Christianity? These are the kinds of questions I'm interested in.

In previous (professional) lives, I have been a newspaper reporter in West Texas, a private-uiversity fundraising and alumni relations writer and editor, and a Central Texas county public information officer. Check out the links at top for more info!
